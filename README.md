# Zeleo Application Library
This is the Java client library for creating Zeleo Applications. You can read the details on how to do this in the Development section [here](https://zeleo.github.io/zeleo/).

## What is Zeleo?
[Zeleo](https://www.zeleo.io) is an event-driven rule engine that allows you to automate system interactions and task-based workflows for a team of people. Think IFTTT or Zapier with task/workflow automation built in, and focused on a team of people.

Read more [here](http://zeleo.github.io/zeleo/development/overview/).

## Setup
To add this library to your project, do one of the following depending on your build system:

### Maven
Add the following XML to your *pom.xml* in the _dependencies_ section:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.zeleo.application</groupId>
  <artifactId>zeleo-application-library</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
In your *build.gradle*, add the following to your _dependencies_ section:
```groovy
dependencies {
  compile 'io.zeleo.application:zeleo-application-library:1.0.1'
}
```

## Use
This library aims to reduce bootstrap code that you would need to write yourself. In practice, this means that the JWT authentication logic is taken care of by methods in this library, and the serialization of the json sent to you from Zeleo to the _ConsequenceData_ object is handled for you.

Start by reading [this](http://zeleo.github.io/zeleo/development/tools/) to define your service in the Zeleo UI.

You will need to define the following, all of which are available in the _Security_ section of your service definition that you created in the _Development Tab_ in the [Zeleo](https://www.zeleo.io) client. The _Token_ is generated for you, and the rest you define; all the fields *must* match _exactly_ for the everything to work. Methods available from this library allow you to pass these values or set them as environment variables which will then be accessed and used automatically. 

The following code in the library gets the values from the environment, but if you prefer every method allows you to alternatively pass these as parameters.

```java
final private static String ZELEO_TOKEN = System.getenv("ZELEO_TOKEN");
final private static String ZELEO_ISSUER = System.getenv("ZELEO_ISSUER");
final private static String ZELEO_AUDIENCE = System.getenv("ZELEO_AUDIENCE");
final private static String ZELEO_SUBJECT = System.getenv("ZELEO_SUBJECT");
final private static String ZELEO_HOST = System.getenv("ZELEO_HOST");
```

Also read [this](http://zeleo.github.io/zeleo/development/authorization/) to learn how to handle the authentication of the other system your service will undoubtedly be interacting with.

## Methods
The entry point for all methods is the ZeleoApplication class. It exposes a handful of static methods that help you converse with the Zeleo platform. Note that each function an overload that allows you to specify the JWT variables or let the library get them from environment variables.

```java
/**
 * Extract the JWT encrypted string from Zeleo into the ConsequenceData object.
 * 
 * @param token The JWT token you want to extract.
 * @param jwtToken The encryption key that you can find in the Development tab in Zeleo.
 * @param issuer The Issuer string that you can find in the Development tab in Zeleo.
 * @param audience The audience string that you can find in the Development tab in Zeleo.
 * @param subject The subject that you can find in the Development tab in Zeleo.
 * @return The ConsequenceData object sent from the Zeleo rule.
 * @throws InvalidJwtException The JWt token could not be extracted.
 * @throws IOException The string extracted from the token could not be serialized to the ConsequenceData object.

## Examples

The following is a simple event fired to Zeleo. This assumes that you have defined it in the _Development Tab_ in the Zeleo client and have an id for that event that can be seen by clicking on the _preview_ icon next to the event in the _Development Tab_.

Read more [here](http://zeleo.github.io/zeleo/development/condition/).

Firing and Event (to be evaluated in the _Condition_ section of a _Rule_):

```java
Map<String, Object> eventData = new HashMap<>();
eventData.put("some_field", "true");
eventData.put("another_field", "something");
ZeleoApplication.fireEvent(EVENT_ID, eventData, HOST, TOKEN, ISSUER, AUDIENCE, SUBJECT);
```

Receiving a Condition. This means you will receive the ConsequenceData object from a webhook if a _Rule Condition_ is *true*.

Read more [here](http://zeleo.github.io/zeleo/development/consequence/).

```java
public void handleConsequence(final String jwtToken) {
  try {
    ConsequenceData consequence = ZeleoApplication.getZeleoConsequence(jwtToken, TOKEN, ISSUER, AUDIENCE, SUBJECT);
    // Do whatever you need to do with the ConsequenceData object.
  } catch (InvalidJwtException | IOException e) {
    context.getLogger().log(ex.getMessage());
  }
}
```
